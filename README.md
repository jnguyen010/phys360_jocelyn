# Projectile Motion of a Penny

## Summary

If you drop two pennies from the top of a tall building, with one penny dropping staight down and another rotating, which penny will reach the ground first?


## Background

For our project, we will see what happens when you drop a penny from the top of a skyscraper or any tall building. We have modeled projectile motions before, where we have considered initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and drag/air resistance. For this project, we want to experiment what will happen when each of these factors are varied. We will also add another variable where the penny is rotating while in the air (changes in the area for air resistance). We can determine if and how rotating will affect the time which the penny will hit the ground. 



## Resources

Our resources will mainly focus on projectile motion and projectile motion with objects in rotation.

## Objective

Our objectives are to graph the path of the penny as the penny rotates and compare it to the graph of the penny as it does not rotate. We also want to find the time at which the pennies reach terminal velocity and how long it takes for them to reach the ground.
